= Ansible playbook for turning three PCs into a set of RHEL VMs

!!! Under construction. Sections marked with !!! and ??? are notes to self. 

Ansible helps me build my home lab. This playbook turns a PC running RHEL 9 into a hypervisor running a pile-load (thatâ€™s the technical term) of Virtual Machines. Each VM runs a set of services that support my home lab.

Idea is to build a model of a business network, complicated enough to help with a wide range of challenges. 
This home lab emulates a complex IT estate, like you might find in a large organization.
